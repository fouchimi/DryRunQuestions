1) My favorite library outside of Android framework is Picasso. This is simply because of its powerful library
for downloading and caching images for our application. It does so by handling our ImageView recycling and download
cancelation in an adapter. Complex image transformations with minimal memory use. Automatic memory and disk caching

It is also easy to use and the developer doesn't have to worry so much of handling the image Loading in the background
thread since the library does that efficiently and load the thumbnail in the imageView. Here is a snapshot of a code
that will load an image in our imageView
Picasso.with(context).load("http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png").into(imageView);


2) Step to open a map from an app
a) Build an URI like Uri geoLocation = Uri.parse("geo:0,0?q=address+city+state+zipcode")
b) Build an implicit intent like Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
c) intent.setData(geoLocation);
d) check if the current android platform support this action of opening a map like
  if(intent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null ) {
    startActivity(intent);
}

3)public static String compress(String input) {
    String result = "";
    if(input.length() == 1 || input.isEmpty()) return input;
    else {
      String[] chars = input.split("");
      LinkedList<String> stack = new LinkedList<String>();
      for(String ch : chars) {
         if(stack.isEmpty() || stack.peek().equals(ch)) {
           stack.push(ch);
         }else {
           result += stack.peek() + stack.size();
           for(int i=0; i<stack.size(); i++) {
             stack.pop();
           }
           stack.push(ch);
       }
    }
    if(!stack.isEmpty()) result += stack.peek() + stack.size();
    return result;
    }
}

4) Differences between the four variants ways of saving data in an Android app.
  a) Shared Preferences (Key-Value sets)
    if we have a small collection of key-values that we would like to save. it is smart to opt
    for shared preferences since it provides simple methods to read and write primitives data types 
    such integer, long, double, String etc...
    Here is an example on how to get a handle of a SharedPreference Object within a fragment
    SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getSharedPreferences(getString(R.string.preference_file_key),
    Context.MODE_PRIVATE);

  b) We can also opt for saving our data within our application. We can write our data on an internal or external
   storage. If we save data within an internal storage it is important to note that our data will only be accessible
   by our application where as if it is share on an External storage then our data can be shared across other devices
   where our app is installed. We have to make sure that we include a specific permission in our manifest file
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
  
  c) Network
   We can also decide to save data pertaining to our application over the network.
   we first start by adding a permission for using internet connection.
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />. This is often done
   by the means of push notification which allows the application to notify a user of new messages or events even the user is not 
   actively using our application. We can use Parse which is by far one of the most popular BAAS for android platforms.
   
  d)SQLite
    SQLite is a light weight database that comes with android. It allows us to save relational and complex data of our application
    by running common SQL queries such as SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE on our tables. We often have to implement a content provider
    for a best pratice for running these queries. The developer is often obligated to extends SQLiteOpenhelper class and override
    two main methods onCreate() and onUpgrade()

5) I like fragments because they are reusable and we can use them efficiently in large display. They are quite similar to Activities
   with a sole difference of very few additional methods such as onCreateView(), onActivityAttach(). They allow the developer
   to take advantage of larger screens to compartmentize our application.

6) If i was to start my Android position today, i will like to publish a full working app in six months time on Google Play Services. 
I would also like to work on some exciting projects such as Android Wear and TV. Building great apps for such devices is indeed a dream 
that i would like to realize.
